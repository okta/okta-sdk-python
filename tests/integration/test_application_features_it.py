"""
Simplified Application Features API Integration Tests

This test focuses on applications that are known to support Application Features API:
- Google Workspace (google)
- Microsoft Office 365 (office365)
- Okta Org2Org (okta_org2org)
- Slack (slack)
- Zoom (zoomus)
- Zscaler 2.0 (zscalerbyz)

The tests will use VCR recording mode to capture real 200 responses.
