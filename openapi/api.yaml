      > **Note:**  Some of the curl code examples on this page include SSWS API token authentication. However, Okta recommends using scoped OAuth 2.0 and OIDC access tokens to authenticate with Okta management APIs. OAuth 2.0 and OIDC access tokens provide fine-grain control over the bearer's actions on specific endpoints.

  - name: CAPTCHA
    x-displayName: CAPTCHAs
    description: |-
      As an option to increase org security, Okta supports CAPTCHA services to prevent automated sign-in attempts. You can integrate one of two providers: [hCaptcha](https://www.hcaptcha.com/) or [reCAPTCHA v2](https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/docs/invisible).

      The vendor implementations supported by Okta are both invisible. They each run risk-analysis software in the background during user sign in to determine the likelihood that the user is a bot. This risk analysis is based on the settings that you configure with the provider that you choose.

      Before you configure your org to use CAPTCHA, sign in to the vendor of your choice or sign up for an account. For more details, refer to [CAPTCHA integration](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=oie&id=csh-captcha).

  - name: CustomTemplates
    x-displayName: Custom Email Templates
    description: |-
      These endpoints allow you to programmatically manage email customizations.

      Okta provides many customizable email templates. For example, the `UserActivation` email template allows users to activate their account. Use email customizations to override a template's default content. See the [list of email templates](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/custom-email/main/#use-customizable-email-templates).

      Each template has default content that Okta translates to any one of the supported languages. The following settings determine the language for emails sent from Okta to a user, if the user hasn't selected a specific display language:
      * The user's locale property value (if specified)
      * The org's display language

      See [Supported languages](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/custom-email/main/#supported-languages).

      The following constraints apply to email customizations:
      * If an email template has any customizations at all, exactly one of them must be the default (where `isDefault` is `true`). Okta uses the default customization when no other customization applies to the user's language settings.
      * Each email template can have only one customization for each supported language.

      ### Enable other locales
      <ApiLifecycle access="ea" />

      Use the [BCP 47 format](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/bcp47) to enable more locales than Okta's 27 default languages.

      Once you create a customization with the new locale, the locale appears in the Admin Console along with the default-supported locales.

      Include `null` in the subject or body of the email customization. Okta replaces `null` with a default value based on the following order of priority:

      - An existing default email customization, if one exists
      - Okta-provided translated content for the specified language, if one exists
      - Okta-provided translated content for the brand locale, if it's set
      - Okta-provided content in English
  - name: Device

      * GET or DELETE device objects
      * Perform lifecycle transitions on the device objects. Device lifecycle is defined as transitions of the device status by the associated operations. The device object follows a predefined lifecycle transition flow. Device lifecycle operations are idempotent and its calls are synchronous.

      The Devices API supports the following authorization schemes:
      * SSWS: [API tokens](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/core-okta-api/#authentication)
      * Bearer: [OAuth2.0 and OpenID Connect](https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/oauth-openid/)

      > **Notes:**
      > * For devices to enroll in Okta and show up in the Devices API, the following actions are required:

      The Directories Integration API provides operations to manage Active Directory (AD) objects in a connected on-premises directory through Okta.

      You can add or remove users from groups based on their identity and access requirements. This ensures that changes made to user access in Okta are reflected in AD. When you use Okta Access Certifications to revoke a user's membership to an AD group, the removal is reflected in AD.

      Okta can only manage group memberships for users and groups imported into Okta using the AD integration. You can't use this API to manage users and groups that weren't imported through AD integration or are outside of the integration's org unit scope.

  - name: LinkedObject
    x-displayName: Linked Objects
    description: |-
      Users have relationships to each other, like manager and subordinate or customer and sales representative. You can create users with relationships by using the Linked Objects API to represent the relationship.

      1. Create a linked object definition such as Manager:Subordinate or Case Worker:Client. These pairs are represented by a `primary` attribute and an `associated` attribute.
      2. Link users together to create the relationship between the two. You create a linked object value with a single request that links one `primary` and one `associated` user.

      For each relationship:

      * A user has at most one `primary` link (a user has a single manager), but can have many `associated` links (a user can have many subordinates).
      * A user can be the `primary` in one relationship and the `associated` in another.
      * A user can be both the `primary` and `associated` in the same relationship.

      Okta Expression Language function for [linked objects](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/okta-expression-language/#linked-object-function) provides access to the details about a linked user.

      > **Note:** The linked objects feature isn't available for OpenID Connect claims.

      ## Example usage

      Okta allows you to create up to 200 linked object definitions. These definitions are one-to-many, for example:

      * A manager has many subordinates. Each subordinate has one manager.
      * A sales representative has many customers. Each customer has one sales rep.
      * A case worker has many clients. Each client has one case worker.

      Most orgs have more than one manager or sales representative. You can create the linked object definition once, and then assign the `primary` relationship to as many users as you have people in that relationship.

      You can assign the `associated` relationship for a single `primary` user to as many users as needed. The `associated` user can be related to only one `primary` per linked object definition. But you can assign a user to more than one linked object definition.

      For example, assume that you've created one linked object definition for manager (`primary`) and for subordinates (`associated`):

      * Joe is Frank's manager.
      * Bob is Joe's manager, but Jane's subordinate.
      * Jane is the CEO, so she reports to herself.

      Thus, you can create chains of relationships (Jane > Bob > Joe > Frank) or terminal relationships (Jane is both `primary` and `associated` user).

      Then, if you create another linked object relationship for scrum team membership, you could assign relationships to the same four users:

      * Bob is the scrum lead for the Identity Scrum team.
      * Joe and Frank are both contributors to the team.

      Bob can be the `primary` for a Manager:Subordinate, an `associated` user for that same linked object definition, and also the `primary` for the Scrumlead:Contributor linked object definition.

      To represent a relationship, create a linked object definition that specifies a `primary` (parent) relationship and an `associated` (child) relationship, and then add a link in which the appropriate user is assigned to each side of that link type.

      ## Links between user types

      If you created multiple user types (see [User Types](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/UserType/)), they all share the same linked object definitions. For example, if you have separate user types for employees and contractors, a link could designate an employee as the manager for a contractor, with the contractor being a subordinate of that employee.

      ## Link definition operations

      Link definition operations allow you to manage the creation and removal of the link definitions. If you remove a link definition, links based on that definition are unavailable.

      > **Note:** Links reappear if you recreate the definition. However, Okta is likely to change this behavior so that links don't reappear. Don't rely on this behavior in production environments.

      They're used for two purposes:
      * `POLICY`: Network Zones used to guide policy decisions
      * `BLOCKLIST`: Network Zones used to deny access from certain IP addresses, locations, Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs), proxy types, or IP service categories before policy evaluation
      > **Note:** The Network Zone blocklist applies to all URLs for the org.

      See [Network zones](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?id=ext_Security_Network) in the Okta product documentation.

      Your Okta org provides the following default system Network Zones that you can modify and use:
      * `LegacyIpZone`: The system default IP Network Zone
      * `BlockedIpZone`: The system default IP Blocklist Network Zone
      * `DefaultEnhancedDynamicZone`: The system default Enhanced Dynamic Network Zone

      You can create and use the following custom Network Zones:
      * IP Network Zone (`IP`): Allows you to define network perimeters around a set of IPs
      * Dynamic Network Zone (`DYNAMIC`): Allows you to define network perimeters around location, IP type, or ASNs
      * Enhanced Dynamic Network Zone (`DYNAMIC_V2`): Extends the Dynamic Network Zone and allows you to include or exclude specific locations, ASNs, or IP service categories

      > **Note:** To create multiple Network Zones, you must have Adaptive MFA enabled in your Okta org.

      The Okta Policy API enables an administrator to perform policy and policy rule operations. The policy framework is used by Okta to control rules and settings that govern many things:
      - user session lifetime
      - whether multi-factor authentication is required when signing in
      - what MFA factors may be employed
      - password complexity requirements
      - what types of self-service operations are permitted under various circumstances
      - which identity provider to route users to

      Policy settings for a particular policy type, such as `SIGN_ON` policy, consist of one or more policy objects, each of which contains one or more policy rules. Policies and rules contain conditions that determine whether they are applicable to a particular user at a particular time.

      See:
      * [Authenticator enrollment policies](https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/policies/#authenticator-enrollment-policies): `MFA_ENROLL`

      * [User profile policies](https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/policies/#user-profile-policies): `PROFILE_ENROLLMENT`

      ### Policy evaluation
      When a policy needs to be retrieved for a particular user, for example when the user attempts to sign in to Okta, or when the user initiates a self-service operation, then a policy evaluation takes place.
      During policy evaluation each policy of the appropriate type is considered in turn, in the order indicated by the policy priority.

      Each of the conditions associated with the policy is evaluated. If one or more of the conditions can't be met, then the next policy in the list is considered. If the conditions can be met, then each of the rules associated with the policy is considered in turn, in the order specified by the rule priority.
      Each of the conditions associated with a given rule is evaluated. If all of the conditions associated with a rule are met, then the settings contained in the rule, and in the associated policy, are applied to the user. If none of the policy rules have conditions that can be met, then the next policy in the list is considered.

      ### Rule priority
      Rules have a priority that govern the order that they are considered during evaluation. The highest priority rule has a priority of `1`. For example, if a particular policy had two rules:
      * Rule A has priority `1` and applies to LDAP API scenarios.
      * Rule B has priority `2` and applies to ANYWHERE (network connection) scenarios.

      If a request came in from the LDAP endpoint, the action in rule A is taken, and rule B isn't evaluated. This occurs because even though requests coming from anywhere match the ANYWHERE location condition of rule B, rule A has higher priority and is evaluated first.

      ### Default rules
      Only the default policy contains a default rule. In Identity Engine, you can't delete default rules, but can edit them, except for:
        * The property `usePersistentCookie` of the default global session policy's default rule, which is read-only.
        * The default identity provider routing rule and the default rule of the default authenticator enrollment policy, which are also read-only.

      #### Policy limitations
      Different policy types control settings for different operations. All policy types share a common framework, message structure, and API, but have different policy settings and rule data. Keep in mind the following policy-specific limitations.

      #### App sign-in policy
      The app sign-in policy has the following limitations:
      * You can have a maximum of 5000 app sign-in policies in an org. There is a max limit of 100 rules allowed per policy. When you create an app sign-in policy, you automatically also create a default policy rule with the lowest priority of `99`. The highest priority that you can set an app sign-in policy rule to is `0`.
      * When you [merge duplicate app sign-in policies](https://help.okta.com/oie/en-us/content/topics/identity-engine/policies/consolidate-auth-policies.htm?cshid=ext-merge-auth-policies), policy and mapping CRUD operations may be unavailable during the consolidation. When the consolidation is complete, you receive an email.

      #### IdP discovery policy
      The IdP discovery policy has the following limitations:
      * You can add up to 10 providers to a single `idp` policy action.
      * You can define only one provider for the following IdP types: `AgentlessDSSO`, `IWA`, `X509`.
      * You can't define a provider if `idpSelectionType` is `DYNAMIC`.
      * You can't define a `providerExpression` if `idpSelectionType` is `SPECIFIC`.
      * If a user identifier condition is defined together with an `OKTA` provider, sign-in requests are handled by Okta exclusively.

      #### Password policy
      The password policy is enforced only for Okta and AD-sourced users. For AD-sourced users, ensure that your Active Directory policies don't conflict with the Okta policies.

      #### User profile policy
      The user profile policy has the following limitations:
      * You can't update or delete the required base attributes in the default user profile: `email`, `firstName`, or `lastName`.
      * You can have a maximum of 500 user profile policies in an org. A user profile policy can only have one rule associated with it. Adding more rules isn't allowed.

      The default rule is required and is always the last rule in the priority order. If you add rules to the default policy, they have a higher priority than the default rule. The `system` object determines whether a rule is created by a system or by a user. The default rule is the only rule that has this attribute.

      * **Group targets:** Grant an admin permission to manage only a specified group. For example, an admin role may be assigned to manage only the IT group.
      * **App targets:** Grant an admin permission to manage all instances of an OIN-cataloged app integration. For example, an admin role can manage all customer instances of an OIN-cataloged app, such as Salesforce or Facebook.
      * **App instance targets:** Grant an admin permission to manage an instance of an OIN-catalog app. For example, there may be a few Salesforce app instances configured for each sales region of an org.

      Okta uses the [Shared Signals Framework (SSF)](https://sharedsignals.guide/) to receive security-related events and other data-subject signals from third-party security vendors. In this scenario, commonly used terms for third-party vendors that send signals are "transmitters", Okta is the "receiver", and the connection between the two entities is referred to as a "stream."

      The SSF Receiver API allows you to manage SSF vendor stream configurations between the transmitter and Okta. A stream is configured by [creating a Security Events Provider](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/SSFReceiver/#tag/SSFReceiver/operation/createSecurityEventsProviderInstance) object in your Okta org. You can create a Security Events Provider object in Okta with a published well-known URL or an issuer-and-JWKS combination.

      After the Security Events Provider object is created for a transmitter, the provider can use the [SSF Security Event Tokens](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/SSFSecurityEventToken/) API to publish events to Okta. While the SSF allows ingestion through push and poll-based operations, Okta currently supports only push-based operations.

      The Shared Signals Framework (SSF) Security Event Tokens API allows third-party security event providers to send Security Event Tokens (SETs) to Okta. The provider must be configured in Okta as a Security Events Provider instance before transmitting a SET to Okta. See [Create a Security Events Provider](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/SSFReceiver/#tag/SSFReceiver/operation/createSecurityEventsProviderInstance). After the token is verified, any appropriate action is performed upon ingestion.

      Okta uses the Shared Signals Framework (SSF) defined by the [OpenID Shared Signals and Events Framework specification](https://openid.net/specs/openid-sse-framework-1_0.html). A risk signal is ingested as a Security Event Token (SET), a type of JSON Web Token (JWT) that must comply with the SET RFC: [RFC 8417 - Security Event Token(SET)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8417). The `security.events.provider.receive_event` System Log event is created when a SET is published to Okta successfully.

      <x-lifecycle class="oie"></x-lifecycle>

      Okta uses the [Shared Signals Framework (SSF)](https://openid.net/specs/openid-sharedsignals-framework-1_0-ID3.html) to send security-related events and other data-subject signals to third-party security vendors. In this scenario, commonly used terms for third-party vendors that receive signals are "receivers", Okta is the "transmitter", and the connection between the two entities is referred to as a "stream."

      The SSF Transmitter API allows you to manage SSF stream configurations between the receiver that receives signals transmitted by Okta. Okta sends signals in the form of [Security Event Tokens (SETs)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8417) to a third-party SSF receiver.

      Okta's SSF Transmitter currently supports two types of CAEP events: [Session Revoked](https://openid.net/specs/openid-caep-1_0-ID2.html#name-session-revoked) and [Credential Change](https://openid.net/specs/openid-caep-1_0-ID2.html#name-credential-change).

      The following Okta events are mapped to the CAEP Session Revoked event:
        - user.session.end

      The following Okta events are mapped to the CAEP Credential Change event:
        - user.mfa.factor.activate
        - user.mfa.factor.deactivate
        - user.mfa.factor.suspend
        - user.mfa.factor.unsuspend
        - user.mfa.factor.update
        - user.mfa.factor.reset_all
        - user.account.reset_password
        - user.account.update_password

      To enable the transmission of signals from Okta, you must create an SSF Stream using the SSF Transmitter API and configure the third-party receiver to accept signals from Okta.
  - name: Schema
    x-displayName: Schemas
    description: |-
      The Schemas API provides operations to manage custom user profiles as well as endpoints to discover the structure of the log stream configuration.

      Okta's [Universal Directory](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?id=ext_About_Universal_Directory) allows admins to define custom user profiles for Okta users and apps.
      Okta adopts a subset of [JSON Schema Draft 4](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-zyp-json-schema-04) as the schema language to describe and validate extensible user profiles.
      For log stream schemas, Okta uses [JSON Schema Draft 2020-12](https://json-schema.org/specification.html).
      [JSON Schema](http://json-schema.org/) is a lightweight declarative format for describing the structure, constraints, and validation of JSON documents.

      > **Note:** Okta implements only a subset of [JSON Schema Draft 4](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-zyp-json-schema-04) and [JSON Schema Draft 2020-12](https://json-schema.org/specification.html). This document describes which parts apply to Okta, and any extensions Okta has made to [JSON Schema Draft 4](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-zyp-json-schema-04) and [JSON Schema Draft 2020-12](https://json-schema.org/specification.html).

      ### Unique Attributes
      You can enforce uniqueness for custom properties in Okta user profiles or the Okta group profile, such as an employee identification number. You can declare a maximum of five unique properties for each user type and five unique properties in the Okta group profile. Different user types can have the same or different unique properties (up to the limit of five per type).

      Unique properties in Okta user profiles share a single namespace across all [user types](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/UserType/) in an org. If user types A and B both contain the property `ice cream` and you identify it as unique in both profiles, then if a user of type A has the value `chocolate`, no other users of type A or B (or any other user type that declares `ice cream` as unique) can have that value.

      Properties that aren't unique also aren't tracked for uniqueness. Suppose the property `candy` is unique in type E and not unique in type F. If a user of type E has the value `caramel` for the `candy` property, no other users of type E can also have the value `caramel`, but any number of users of type F can already have or later be assigned the value `caramel`. Furthermore, because `candy` is not unique in type F, any values users of type F may have are not considered when enforcing uniqueness for users of type E. No matter how many users of type F already have the value `cotton`, it might be assigned to a user of type E as long as no other such user already has that value.

      If you attempt to create or update a user with a duplicate value for a custom user property with a uniqueness restriction, the user creation or update operation fails. The user isn't created or updated until you enter a unique value. Similarly, creating or updating a group fails when the request contains a value for a unique custom group property that is duplicated by another group.

      `null` values don't enter into the uniqueness calculation. If the unique property isn't also specified as being required, you can also omit the value entirely. Multiple users or groups can omit the property and not violate uniqueness.

      To enforce uniqueness for custom properties, you can either add new unique custom properties or update existing custom properties to be unique.

      #### Add new unique custom property

      You can use the [add property to user profile schema](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/Schema/#tag/Schema/operation/updateUserProfile) request or the [add property to group profile schema](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/Schema/#tag/Schema/operation/updateGroupSchema) request to add one or more unique custom user or group properties. Specify `"unique": true` on the properties to be marked as unique. The response shows the properties with `"unique": "UNIQUE_VALIDATED"` and uniqueness is then enforced on those properties.

      #### Update existing custom property to be unique

      You can use the [update user profile schema property](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/Schema/#tag/Schema/operation/updateUserProfile) request or the [update group profile schema property](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/Schema/#tag/Schema/operation/updateGroupSchema) request to mark existing custom user or group properties as unique by specifying `"unique": true` on the properties to be marked as unique.

      After the request to mark existing custom properties as unique is submitted, an asynchronous validation check is performed to make sure that there are no existing duplicate entries. If you have a significant number of users or groups, the validation can take some time.

      A uniqueness status of `"unique": "PENDING_UNIQUENESS"` indicates that the validation check is still in progress. Use the Universal Directory page in the Admin Console (**Directory** > **Directory Integrations**) to track the status of the validation check. After the validation completes, if you submit a retrieve user schema request or a retreive group schema request, the property's uniqueness status changes to `UNIQUE_VALIDATED` if no duplicate records are found, and uniqueness is then enforced on that property. Otherwise, if duplicate records are found, the `unique` attribute of the schema property isn't shown in the get schema request and uniqueness isn't enforced on the schema property.

      #### Update existing unique custom property to be non-unique

      You can use the [update user profile schema property](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/Schema/#tag/Schema/operation/updateUserProfile) request or the [update group profile schema property](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/Schema/#tag/Schema/operation/updateGroupSchema) request to change existing unique custom user or group properties to be non-unique by specifying `"unique": false` on the properties to be changed to non-unique. The response shows the properties without the `unique` attribute and the uniqueness constraint is then removed on those properties.

      **Note:** If multiple user types declare a property as unique and you remove the uniqueness constraint on one type, there may be a delay before users of other types that declare the property as unique can be assigned values formerly held by users of the first type.

      Okta uses a cookie-based authentication mechanism to maintain a user's authentication Session across web requests. The Okta Sessions API provides operations to create and manage authentication Sessions for users in your Okta organization.

      >**Notes:**
      > * Some browsers block third-party cookies by default, which disrupts Okta functionality in certain flows. See [Mitigate the impact of third-party cookie deprecation](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=oie&id=ext-third-party-cookies).
      > * The Sessions API doesn't support direct authentication. Direct authentication is supported through the [Authentication API](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/authn/#authentication-operations) or through OIDC using the [Resource Owner Password flow](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/implement-grant-type/ropassword/main/).

      ### Session cookie

      Okta uses an HTTP session cookie to provide access to your Okta organization and applications across web requests for an interactive user agent such as a web browser. A session cookie has an expiration configurable by an administrator for the organization and is valid until the cookie expires or the user closes the Session (logout) or browser application.

      ### Session token

      A [session token](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/authn/#session-token) is a one-time bearer token that provides proof of authentication and may be redeemed for an interactive SSO session in Okta in a user agent. Session tokens can only be used **once** to establish a Session for a user and are revoked when the token expires.

      Okta provides a very rich [Authentication API](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/authn/) to validate a [user's primary credentials](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/authn/#primary-authentication) and secondary [MFA factor](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/authn/#verify-factor). A session token is returned after successful authentication, which can be later exchanged for a session cookie that uses one of the following flows:

      - [Retrieve a session cookie by visiting the OpenID Connect Authorization Endpoint](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/session-cookie/main/#retrieve-a-session-cookie-through-the-openid-connect-authorization-endpoint)
      - [Retrieve a session cookie by visiting a session redirect link](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/session-cookie/main/#retrieve-a-session-cookie-by-visiting-a-session-redirect-link)
      - [Retrieve a session cookie by visiting an application embed link](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/session-cookie/main/#retrieve-a-session-cookie-by-visiting-an-application-embed-link)

      >**Note:** **Session tokens** are secrets and should be protected at rest and during transit. A session token for a user is equivalent to having the user's actual credentials.

      The Okta System Log records system events that are related to your organization in order to provide an audit trail that can be used to understand platform activity and to diagnose problems.

      The System Log API provides near real-time, read-only access to your organization's System Log and is the programmatic counterpart of the [System Log UI](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?id=ext_Reports_SysLog).

      The terms "event" and "log event" are often used interchangeably. In the context of this API, an "event" is an occurrence of interest within the system, and a "log" or "log event" is the recorded fact.

      The System Log API supports these primary use cases:

        * Event data export into a security information and event management system (SIEM)
        * System monitoring
        * Development debugging
        * Event introspection and audit

      > **Note:** Some of the curl code examples on this page include SSWS API token authentication. However, Okta recommends using scoped OAuth 2.0 and OIDC access tokens to authenticate with Okta management APIs. OAuth 2.0 and OIDC access tokens provide fine-grain control over the bearer's actions on specific endpoints. See [Okta API authentication methods](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-oauth/guides/overview/).

See [Create an authenticator enrollment policy](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=oie&id=ext-create-mfa-policy).\n\nBased on the group memberships that are specified when the user is created, a password may or may not be required to make the user's status `ACTIVE`. The groups assigned to the user determines the enrollment policy applied to the user. If the enrollment policy has the password authenticator set to `required`, then the user's status is determined by if the user is created with a password:\n\n* Created with a password - the user status is set to `PROVISIONED` and a One-Time Token is sent to the user through email\n* Created without a password - the user status is set to `ACTIVE` and they can immediately sign in using their password authenticator\n\nIf the user doesn't have an enrolled authenticator, Okta sets the user to `PROVISIONED` and sends an activation link. The user must click the activation link before they can sign in. The activation link provides a baseline assurance that can be used to enroll in other authenticators. If the user has one or more enrolled authenticators at activation time, they're set to `ACTIVE` and can sign in directly.\n\nSee [Passwordless authentication](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=oie&id=ext-passwordless-auth) in the help documentation.\n\n#### Create user without credentials\n\nCreates a user without a `password` or a recovery `question` and `answer`.\n\nIf appropriate, when the user is activated, an email is sent to the user with an activation token that the user can use to complete the activation process.\n\nThis is the default flow for new user registration using the Admin Console.\n\n#### Create user with recovery question\n\nCreates a user without a `password`.\n\nWhen the user is activated, an email is sent to the user with an activation token that can be used to complete the activation process.\nThis flow is useful if migrating users from an existing user store.\n\n#### Create user with password\n\nCreates a user without a recovery `question` and `answer`.\n\nThe new user is able to sign in after activation with the assigned password.

Users should login with their imported password.\n\n#### Create user with password import inline hook\n\nCreates a user with a `Password Hook` object specifying that a password inline hook should be used to handle password verification.\n\nThe password inline hook is triggered to handle verification of the end user's password the first time the user tries to sign in, with Okta calling the password inline hook to check that the password the user supplied is valid. If the password is valid, Okta stores the hash of the password that was provided and can authenticate the user independently from then on. See [Create a password import inline hook](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/InlineHook/#tag/InlineHook/operation/createPasswordImportInlineHook) for more details.\n\nThe new user is able to sign in after activation with the valid password. This flow supports migrating users from another data store in cases where we wish to allow the users to retain their current passwords.\n> **Important:** Don't generate or send a one-time activation token when activating users with an password inline hook. Users should sign in with their existing password to be imported using the password import inline hook.\n\n#### Create user with password and recovery question\n\nCreates a new user with a password and recovery `question` and `answer`.\n\nThe new user is able to log in with the assigned password after activation. This flow is common when developing a custom user-registration experience.\n> **Important:** Don't generate or send a one-time activation token when activating users with an assigned password. Users should login with their assigned password.\n\n#### Create user with authentication provider\n\nCreates a new passwordless user with a `SOCIAL` or `FEDERATION` authentication provider that must be authenticated through a trusted identity provider.\n\n#### Create user in group\n\nCreates a user that is added to the specified groups upon creation.\n\nUse this in conjunction with other create operations for a group admin that's scoped to create users only in specified groups. The request can specify up to 20 group IDs. (This limit applies only when creating a user. You can add the user later to more groups.)\n\n#### Create user with non-default user type\n\nCreates a user with a specified user type. You can include the type specification with any of the above Create user operations. This example demonstrates creating a user without credentials.\nThe user type determines which [Schema](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/Schema/) applies to that user. After you create a user, you can assign the user a different user type using the full replacement [PUT operation](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/UserType/#tag/UserType/operation/replaceUserType).\n\n### Links object\n\nThe links object specifies link relations. See [`_links`](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/User/#tag/User/operation/listUsers!c=200&path=_links&t=response).\n\n> **Note:** This links object is different from [linked objects](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/LinkedObject/).\n\n#### Individual users versus collection of users\n\nFor an individual user result, the links object contains a full set of link relations available for that user as determined by your policies. For a collection of users, the links object contains only the `self` link. Operations that return a collection of users include [List all users](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/User/#tag/User/operation/listUsers) and [List all member users](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/Group/#tag/Group/operation/listGroupUsers).\n\nThe following table shows some links that may be available on a user, as determined by your policies:\n\n|   Link Relation Type   |                                                  Description                                                                                                                        |\n|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|self\t                   |  A self-referential link to this user                                                                                                                                               |\n|activate\t               |  Lifecycle action to [activate the user](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/UserLifecycle/#tag/UserLifecycle/operation/activateUser)                                           |\n|deactivate              |\tLifecycle action to [deactivate the user](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/UserLifecycle/#tag/UserLifecycle/operation/deactivateUser)                                       |\n|suspend                 |\tLifecycle action to [suspend the user](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/UserLifecycle/#tag/UserLifecycle/operation/suspendUser)                                             |\n|unsuspend               |\tLifecycle action to [unsuspend the user](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/UserLifecycle/#tag/UserLifecycle/operation/unsuspendUser)                                         |\n|resetPassword           |\tLifecycle action to [trigger a password reset](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/UserCred/#tag/UserCred/operation/resetPassword)                                             |\n|expirePassword          |\tLifecycle action to [expire the user's password](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/UserCred/#tag/UserCred/operation/expirePassword)                                          |\n|resetFactors            |\tLifecycle action to [reset all MFA factors](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/UserLifecycle/#tag/UserLifecycle/operation/resetFactors)                                       |\n|unlock                  |\tLifecycle action to [unlock a locked-out user](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/UserLifecycle/#tag/UserLifecycle/operation/unlockUser)                                      |\n|forgotPassword          |\t[Resets a user's password](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/UserCred/#tag/UserCred/operation/forgotPassword) by validating the user's recovery credential.                  |\n|changePassword          |\t[Changes a user's password](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/UserCred/#tag/UserCred/operation/changePassword) validating the user's current password                        |\n|changeRecoveryQuestion  |\t[Changes a user's recovery credential](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/UserCred/#tag/UserCred/operation/changeRecoveryQuestion) by validating the user's current password  |"
  - name: UserAuthenticatorEnrollments
    x-displayName: User Authenticator Enrollments
    description: |-
      The Authenticator Enrollments API provides operations for admins to manage the authenticator enrollments of their users.

      An authenticator enrollment is the specific instance of an authenticator that a user has enrolled. For example, if a user enrolls an `sms` method with a phone number, they can use both `sms` and `voice` methods. The Authenticator Enrollments API allows admins to manage both of those user enrollments.

  - name: UserFactor
    x-displayName: User Factors
    description: |-
      The Factors API provides operations to enroll, manage, and verify factors for multifactor authentication (MFA). Generally, authentication involves verifying a different one-time passcode (OTP). Manage both administration and end-user accounts, or verify an individual factor at any time.
      Okta supports several different types of factors:

      | Factor Type           | Description |
      |-----------------------|-------------|
      | `call`                | Software OTP sent using a voice call to a registered phone number |
      | `sms`                 | Software OTP sent using SMS to a registered phone number |
      | `email`               | Software OTP sent using email |
      | `question`            | Additional knowledge-based security question |
      | `push`                | Out-of-band verification using a push notification to a device and transaction verification with digital signature |
      | `token`               | Software or hardware OTP sent to a device |
      | `token:hardware`      | Hardware OTP sent to a device |
      | `token:hotp`          | Custom [TOTP](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6238.txt) factor that uses an extension of the [HMAC (Hash-Based Message Authentication Codes)](https://www.okta.com/identity-101/hmac/)-based one-time passcode (HOTP) algorithm |
      | `token:software:totp` | Software time-based one-time passcode (TOTP) |
      | `u2f`                 | Hardware Universal 2nd Factor (U2F) device |
      | `web`                 | HTML inline frame (iframe) for embedding verification from a third party |
      | `webauthn`            | Hardware WebAuthn device |
      | `signed_nonce`        | Okta Fastpass (device-bound authentication). This is available for OIE orgs if the org has users that have enrolled with Okta Verify after the org started using OIE. The `signed_nonce` factor type can only be retrieved using GET operations or deleted using the [DELETE](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/UserFactor/#tag/UserFactor/operation/unenrollFactor) operation. It cannot be enrolled, activated, or verified through other HTTP methods with the Factors API. |
  - name: UserGrant
    x-displayName: User Grants
    description: |-
      The User Grants API provides operations to manage user consent grants in your org.

      A consent represents a user's explicit permission to allow an app to access resources protected by scopes. Consent grants are different from tokens because a consent can outlast a token. Also, there can be multiple tokens with varying sets of scopes derived from a single consent. When an app comes back and needs to get a new access token, it may not need to prompt the user for consent. This happens if they've already consented to the specified scopes. Consent grants remain valid until the user manually revokes them, or until the user, app, authorization server, or scope is deactivated or deleted.

      > **Hint:** For all grant operations, you can use `me` instead of the `userId` in an endpoint that contains `/users`, in an active session with no SSWS token (API token). For example: `https://${yourOktaDomain}/api/v1/users/me/grants` returns all the grants for the active session user.

      > **Note:** Some browsers have begun blocking third-party cookies by default, disrupting Okta functionality in certain flows. For more information, see [FAQ: How Blocking Third Party Cookies Can Potentially Impact Your Okta Environment](https://support.okta.com/help/s/article/FAQ-How-Blocking-Third-Party-Cookies-Can-Potentially-Impact-Your-Okta-Environment).
  - name: UserLifecycle
    x-displayName: User Lifecycle
    description: |-
      The User Lifecycle API provides lifecycle operations, which are non-idempotent operations that initiate a state transition for a user's status. Some operations are asynchronous while others are synchronous.
      The user's current status limits what operations are allowed.
  - name: UserLinkedObject
    x-displayName: User Linked Objects
    description: |-
      The User Linked Objects API provides operations to manage user linked objects in your org.
      Use link value operations to assign users to a relationship, represented by a pair of `primary` and `associated` links. See also the [Linked Objects API](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/LinkedObject/).

      For these operations, the examples use consistent IDs so that you can follow the operations more easily:
      * `manager` is the `primary` relationship and is assigned `00u5t60iloOHN9pBi0h7`
      * `subordinate` is the `associated` relationship and is assigned to IDs `00u5zex6ztMbOZhF50h7` and `00u1tsf0nQKavLDUh0g5`
  - name: UserOAuth
    x-displayName: User OAuth 2.0 Token Management
    description: |-
      The User OAuth 2.0 Token Management API provides operations to manage tokens issued by an authorization server for a particular user and client in your org. For example, you can revoke every active refresh token for a user in the context of a specific client. You can also [revoke specific tokens](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/revoke-tokens/main/) or [manage tokens at the authorization server level](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/AuthorizationServer/).

      The WebAuthn preregistration API provides a flow to initiate and set up WebAuthn preregistration authenticator enrollments through third-party fulfillment providers.

      > **Note:** For information about using WebAuthn preregistration with YubiKeys, see [Require phishing-resistant authentication with pre-enrolled YubiKey](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=oie&id=csh-preenrolled-yubikey-main).

      Use the following sequence of endpoints to set up WebAuthn preregistration authenticator enrollments.

        1. [Generate a fulfillment request](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/WebAuthnPreregistration/#tag/WebAuthnPreregistration/operation/generateFulfillmentRequest)
        2. [Enroll a preregistered WebAuthn factor](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/WebAuthnPreregistration/#tag/WebAuthnPreregistration/operation/enrollPreregistrationEnrollment)
        3. [Activate a preregistered WebAuthn factor](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/WebAuthnPreregistration/#tag/WebAuthnPreregistration/operation/activatePreregistrationEnrollment)

      After you set up the preregistered WebAuthn factor, you can send the PIN to the user.

        Adds a new JSON Web Key to the client`s JSON Web Keys.
        > **Note:** This API doesn't allow you to add a key if the existing key doesn't have a `kid`. This is also consistent with how the [Dynamic Client Registration](/openapi/okta-oauth/oauth/tag/Client/) or [Applications](/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/Application/) APIs behave, as they don't allow the creation of multiple keys without `kids`. Use the [Replace an Application](/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/Application/#tag/Application/operation/replaceApplication) or the [Replace a Client Application](/openapi/okta-oauth/oauth/tag/Client/#tag/Client/operation/replaceClient) operation to update the JWKS or [Delete an OAuth 2.0 Client JSON Web Key](/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/ApplicationSSOPublicKeys/#tag/ApplicationSSOPublicKeys/operation/deletejwk) and re-add the key with a `kid`.

            Assignments to SSO apps typically don't include a user profile.
            However, if your SSO app requires a profile but doesn't have provisioning enabled, you can add profile attributes in the request body.

          * SSO and provisioning<br>
            Assignments to SSO and provisioning apps typically include credentials and an app-specific profile.
            Profile mappings defined for the app are applied first before applying any profile properties that are specified in the request body.
            > **Notes:**
            > * When Universal Directory is enabled, you can only specify profile properties that aren't defined in profile mappings.
            > * Omit mapped properties during assignment to minimize assignment errors.

        For directories like Active Directory and LDAP, they act as the owner of the user's credential with Okta delegating authentication (DelAuth) to that directory.
        If this request is successful for a user when DelAuth is enabled, then the user is in a state with no password. You can then reset the user's password.

        > **Important:** This is a destructive operation. You can't recover the user's app profile. If the app is enabled for provisioning and configured to deactivate users, the user is also deactivated in the target app.

        Rotates the current Keys for a Custom Authorization Server. If you rotate Keys,
        the `ACTIVE` Key becomes the `EXPIRED` Key, the `NEXT` Key becomes the `ACTIVE` Key,
        and the Custom Authorization Server immediately begins using the new active
        Key to sign tokens.

        > **Note:** Okta rotates your Keys automatically in `AUTO` mode. You can rotate Keys
        yourself in either mode. If Keys are rotated manually, you should invalidate any intermediate cache.
        and fetch the Keys again using the Keys endpoint.

However, when custom email templates are sent to super admins as part of actual email notification flows, the customizations aren't applied. Instead, the default email template is used. This only applies to super admins.

        Lists all devices with pagination support.

        >**Note:** To list all devices enrolled by a user, use the [List all devices endpoint in the User Resources API](/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/UserResources/#tag/UserResources/operation/listUserDevices).

        You can return a subset of devices that match a supported search criteria using the `search` query parameter.
        Searches for devices based on the properties specified in the `search` parameter conforming SCIM filter specifications (case-insensitive). This data is eventually consistent. The API returns different results depending on specified queries in the request. Empty list is returned if no objects match `search` request.

        > **Note:** The `search` parameter results are sourced from an eventually consistent datasource and may not reflect the latest information.

        Don't use search results directly for record updates, as the data might be stale and therefore overwrite newer data, resulting in data loss.

        Use an `id` lookup for records that you update to ensure your results contain the latest data.

        This operation requires [URL encoding](https://www.w3.org/TR/html4/interact/forms.html#h-17.13.4.1). For example, `search=profile.displayName eq "Bob"` is encoded as `search=profile.displayName%20eq%20%22Bob%22`.

        Upserts (creates or renews) the `MANUAL` certificate for the custom domain

        > **Notes:**
        > * If the existing `certificateSourceType` is `OKTA_MANAGED`, this operation changes the source type to `MANUAL`. Okta no longer manages and renews certificates for this domain after you provide a user-managed certificate.
        > * Okta supports TLS certificates and private keys that are PEM-encoded and 2048, 3072, or 4096 bits. See the [Custom domain guide](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/custom-url-domain/main/) for more details.

      summary: Verify a custom domain
      description: |-
        Verifies the custom domain and validity of DNS records by `domainId`. Verify your custom domain to confirm that you own or control the domain and that you have properly configured the required DNS records. Furthermore, if the `certificateSourceType` in the domain is `OKTA_MANAGED`, then an attempt is made to obtain and install a certificate. After a certificate is obtained and installed by Okta, Okta manages the certificate including certificate renewal.

        Verify your custom domain after you've [created it](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/CustomDomain/#tag/CustomDomain/operation/createCustomDomain) and after you've added your TXT and CNAME records to your domain provider. Okta doesn't verify your domain automatically. You must use the API to verify your custom domain if you change your DNS records or if you encounter issues with domain validation.

        > **Note:** DNS record changes can take time to propagate. If you recently updated your DNS records, you may need to wait before verifying your custom domain. If you encounter issues with domain verification, double-check your DNS records and ensure that they're correctly configured. See [Update your DNS TXT](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/custom-url-domain/main/#update-your-dns-txt) for more information about verifying your custom domain.

      summary: Create an event hook
      description: |-
        Creates a new event hook for your organization in `ACTIVE` status. You pass an event hook object in the JSON payload
        of your request. That object represents the set of required information about the event hook you're registering, including:
          * The URI of your external service
          * The [events](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/event-types/) in Okta you want to subscribe to
          * An optional event hook filter that can reduce the number of event hook calls. This is a self-service Early Access (EA) feature.
            See [Create an event hook filter](https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/event-hooks/#create-an-event-hook-filter).

            Additionally, you can specify a secret API key for Okta to pass to your external service endpoint for security verification. Note that the API key you set here is unrelated to the Okta API token
        you must supply when making calls to Okta APIs. Optionally, you can specify extra headers that Okta passes to your external
        service with each call.
        Your external service must use a valid HTTPS endpoint.

        Updates a feature's lifecycle status. Use this endpoint to enable or disable a feature for your org.

        Use the `mode=force` parameter to override dependency restrictions for a particular feature. Normally, you can't enable a feature if it has one or more dependencies that aren't enabled.

        When you use the `mode=force` parameter while enabling a feature, Okta first tries to enable any disabled features that this feature may have as dependencies. If you don't pass the `mode=force` parameter and the feature has dependencies that need to be enabled before the feature is enabled, a 400 error is returned.

        When you use the `mode=force` parameter while disabling a feature, Okta first tries to disable any enabled features that this feature may have as dependents. If you don't pass the `mode=force` parameter and the feature has dependents that need to be disabled before the feature is disabled, a 400 error is returned.

        > **Note:** To list all groups belonging to a member, use the [List all groups endpoint in the User Resources API](/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/UserResources/#tag/UserResources/operation/listUserGroups).

        The number of groups returned depends on the specified [`limit`](/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/Group/#tag/Group/operation/listGroups!in=query&path=limit&t=request), if you have a search, filter, and/or query parameter set, and if that parameter is not null. We recommend using a limit less than or equal to 200.

        A subset of groups can be returned that match a supported filter expression, query, or search criteria.

        > **Note:** The `search` parameter results are sourced from an eventually consistent datasource and may not reflect the latest information.

            Searches for groups with a supported [filtering](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/#filter) expression for all properties except for `_embedded`, `_links`, and `objectClass`. Okta recommends this query parameter because it provides the largest range of search options and optimal performance.

            This operation supports [pagination](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/#pagination).

            Using search requires [URL encoding](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Percent-encoding), for example, `search=type eq "OKTA_GROUP"` is encoded as `search=type+eq+%22OKTA_GROUP%22`.

            This operation searches many properties:

            * Any group profile attribute, including imported app group profile attributes.
            * The top-level properties: `id`, `created`, `lastMembershipUpdated`, `lastUpdated`, and `type`.
            * The [source](/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/Group/#tag/Group/operation/listGroups!c=200&path=_links/source&t=response) of groups with type of `APP_GROUP`, accessed as `source.id`.

            You can also use the `sortBy` and `sortOrder` parameters.

            Searches for groups can be filtered by the following operators: `sw`, `eq`, and `co`. You can only use `co` with these select profile attributes: `profile.name` and `profile.description`. See [Operators](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/#operators).

      summary: Assign a role to a group
      description: |-
        Assigns a [standard role](/openapi/okta-management/guides/roles/#standard-roles) to a group.

        You can also assign a custom role to a group, but the preferred method to assign a custom role to a group is to create a binding between the custom role, the resource set, and the group. See [Create a role resource set binding](/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/RoleDResourceSetBinding/#tag/RoleDResourceSetBinding/operation/createResourceSetBinding).

        > **Notes:**
        > * The request payload is different for standard and custom role assignments.
        > * For IAM-based standard role assignments, use the request payload for standard roles. However, the response payload for IAM-based role assignments is similar to the custom role's assignment response.

        Creates a new identity provider (IdP) integration.

        #### SAML 2.0 IdP

        You must first add the IdP's signature certificate to the IdP key store before you can add a SAML 2.0 IdP with a `kid` credential reference.

        Don't use `fromURI` to automatically redirect a user to a particular app after successfully authenticating with a third-party IdP. Instead, use SAML deep links. Using `fromURI` isn't tested or supported. For more information about using deep links when signing users in using an SP-initiated flow, see [Understanding SP-Initiated Login flow](https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/saml/#understanding-sp-initiated-login-flow).

        Use SAML deep links to automatically redirect the user to an app after successfully authenticating with a third-party IdP. To use deep links, assemble these three parts into a URL:

        * SP ACS URL<br>
        For example: `https://${yourOktaDomain}/sso/saml2/:idpId`
        * The app to which the user is automatically redirected after successfully authenticating with the IdP <br>
        For example: `/app/:app-location/:appId/sso/saml`
        * Optionally, if the app is an outbound SAML app, you can specify the `relayState` passed to it.<br>
        For example: `?RelayState=:anyUrlEncodedValue`

        The deep link for the above three parts is:<br>
        `https://${yourOktaDomain}/sso/saml2/:idpId/app/:app-location/:appId/sso/saml?RelayState=:anyUrlEncodedValue`

        #### Smart Card X509 IdP

        You must first add the IdP's server certificate to the IdP key store before you can add a Smart Card `X509` IdP with a `kid` credential reference.
        You need to upload the whole trust chain as a single key using the [Key Store API](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/IdentityProviderKeys/#tag/IdentityProviderKeys/operation/createIdentityProviderKey).
        Depending on the information stored in the smart card, select the proper [template](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/okta-expression-language/#idp-user-profile) `idpuser.subjectAltNameEmail` or `idpuser.subjectAltNameUpn`.

        #### Identity verification vendors as identity providers

        Identity verification (IDV) vendors work like IdPs, with a few key differences. IDV vendors verify your user's identities by requiring them to submit a proof of identity. There are many ways to verify user identities. For example, a proof of identity can be a selfie to determine liveliness or it can be requiring users to submit a photo of their driver's license and matching that information with a database.

        There are three IDV vendors (Persona, CLEAR Verified, and Incode) with specific configuration settings and another IDV vendor type (Custom IDV) that lets you create a custom IDV vendor, using a [standardized IDV process](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/idv-integration/main/). You can configure each of the IDV vendors as IdPs in your org by creating an account with the vendor, and then creating an IdP integration. Control how the IDVs verify your users by using [Okta account management policy rules](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/okta-account-management-policy/main/).

      description: |-
        Creates an inline hook

        This endpoint creates an inline hook for your org in an `ACTIVE` status. You need to pass an inline hooks object in the JSON payload of your request.
        That object represents the set of required information about the inline hook that you're registering, including:

        * The URI of your external service endpoint
        * The type of inline hook you're registering
        * The type of authentication you're registering

        There are two authentication options that you can configure for your inline hook: HTTP headers and OAuth 2.0 tokens.

        HTTP headers let you specify a secret API key that you want Okta to pass to your external service endpoint (so that your external service can check for its presence as a security measure).

        >**Note:** The API key that you set here is unrelated to the Okta API token you must supply when making calls to Okta APIs.

        You can also optionally specify extra headers that you want Okta to pass to your external service with each call.

        To configure HTTP header authentication, see parameters for the `config` object.

        OAuth 2.0 tokens provide enhanced security between Okta and your external service. You can configure these tokens for the following types&mdash;client secret and private key.

        >**Note:** Your external service's endpoint needs to be a valid HTTPS endpoint. The URI you specify should always begin with `https://`.

        The total number of inline hooks that you can create in an Okta org is limited to 50, which is a combined total for any combination of inline hook types.

        Executes the inline hook that matches the provided `inlineHookId` by using the request body as the input. This inline hook sends the provided
        data through the `channel` object and returns a response if it matches the correct data contract. Otherwise it returns an error. You need to
        construct a JSON payload that matches the payloads that Okta would send to your external service for this inline hook type.

        A timeout of three seconds is enforced on all outbound requests, with one retry in the event of a timeout or an error response from the remote system.
        If a successful response isn't received after the request, a 400 error is returned with more information about what failed.

        >**Note:** This execution endpoint isn't tied to any other functionality in Okta, and you should only use it for testing purposes.

      description: |-
        Replaces the log stream object properties for a given ID.

        This operation is typically used to update the configuration of a log stream.
        Depending on the type of log stream you want to update, certain properties can't be modified after the log stream is initially created.
        Use the [Retrieve the log stream schema for the schema type](/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/Schema/#tag/Schema/operation/getLogStreamSchema) request to determine which properties you can update for the specific log stream type.
        Log stream properties with the `"writeOnce" : true` attribute can't be updated after creation.
        You must still specify these `writeOnce` properties in the request body with the original values in the PUT request.

        > **Note:** You don't have to specify properties that have both the `"writeOnce": true` and the `"writeOnly": true` attributes in the PUT request body. These property values are ignored even if you add them in the PUT request body.

      description: |-
        Lists all profile mappings in your org with [pagination](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/#pagination). You can return a subset of profile mappings that match a supported `sourceId` and/or `targetId`.

        The results are [paginated](/#pagination) according to the `limit` parameter. If there are multiple pages of results, the Link header contains a `next` link that you should treat as an opaque value (follow it, don't parse it). See [Link Header](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/#link-header).

        The response is a collection of profile mappings that include a subset of the profile mapping object's parameters. The profile mapping object describes
        the properties mapping between an Okta user and an app user profile using [JSON Schema Draft 4](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-zyp-json-schema-04).

      description: |-
        Updates a user schema. Use this request to update, add, or remove one or more profile properties in a user schema. If you specify `default` for the `schemaId`, updates will apply to the default user type.

        Unlike custom user profile properties, limited changes are allowed to base user profile properties (permissions, nullability of the `firstName` and `lastName` properties, or pattern for `login`).
        You can't remove a property from the default schema if it's being referenced as a [`matchAttribute`](/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/IdentityProvider/#tag/IdentityProvider/operation/createIdentityProvider!path=policy/subject/matchAttribute&t=request) in `SAML2` IdPs.
        Currently, all validation of SAML assertions are only performed against the default user type.

        > **Note:** You must set properties explicitly to `null` to remove them from the schema; otherwise, `POST` is interpreted as a partial update.

        > * Some features associated with products, such as Atspoke, Workflows, and Okta Identity Governance, aren't propagated to the child org.
        > * Wait at least 30 seconds after a 201-Created response before you make API requests to the new child org.
        > * For rate limits, see [Org creation rate limits](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/rl-additional-limits/#org-creation-rate-limits).

        Creates an SSF Stream for an event receiver to start receiving security events in the form of Security Event Tokens (SETs) from Okta.

        An SSF Stream is associated with the Client ID of the OAuth 2.0 access token used to create the stream. The Client ID is provided by Okta for an [OAuth 2.0 app integration](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?id=ext_Apps_App_Integration_Wizard-oidc). One SSF Stream is allowed for each Client ID, hence, one SSF Stream is allowed for each app integration in Okta.

        A maximum of 10 SSF Stream configurations can be created for one org.

        Lists users in your org, with pagination in most cases.

        A subset of users can be returned that match a supported filter expression or search criteria. Different results are returned depending on specified queries in the request.

        > **Notes:**
        >  * This operation omits users that have a status of `DEPROVISIONED` in the response. To return all users, use a filter or search query instead.

          description: |-
            Searches for users with a supported filtering expression for most properties. Okta recommends this query parameter because it provides the largest range of search options and optimal performance.

            > **Note:** Using an overly complex or long search query can result in an error.

            This operation supports [pagination](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/#pagination). Use an ID lookup for records that you update to ensure your results contain the latest data. Returned users include those with the `DEPROVISIONED` status.

            Property names in the search parameter are case sensitive, whereas operators (`eq`, `sw`, and so on) and string values are case insensitive. Unlike with user logins, diacritical marks are significant in search string values: a search for `isaac.brock` finds `Isaac.Brock`, but doesn't find a property whose value is `isáàc.bröck`.

            This operation requires [URL encoding](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Percent-encoding). See [Special characters](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/#special-characters).

            This operation searches many properties:
              * Any user profile attribute, including custom-defined attributes
              * The top-level properties: `id`, `status`, `created`, `activated`, `statusChanged`, and `lastUpdated`
              * The [user type](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/UserType/#tag/UserType/operation/updateUserType) accessed as `type.id`
              * Properties that have array values

            > **Note:** <x-lifecycle class="ea"></x-lifecycle> The ability to search by user classification is available as an [Early Access](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/guides/release-lifecycle/#early-access-ea) feature. The `classification.type` property cannot be used in conjunction with other search terms. You can search using `classification.type eq "LITE"` or `classification.type eq "STANDARD"`.

            You can also use `sortBy` and `sortOrder` parameters. The `ne` (not equal) operator isn't supported, but you can obtain the same result by using `lt ... or ... gt`. For example, to see all users except those that have a status of `STAGED`, use `(status lt "STAGED" or status gt "STAGED")`.

            You can search properties that are arrays. If any element matches the search term, the entire array (object) is returned. Okta follows the [SCIM Protocol Specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7644#section-3.4.2.2) for searching arrays. You can search multiple arrays, multiple values in an array, as well as using the standard logical and filtering operators. See [Filter](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/core-okta-api/#filter).

            Searches for users can be filtered by the following operators: `sw`, `eq`, and `co`. You can only use `co` with these select user profile attributes: `profile.firstName`, `profile.lastName`, `profile.email`, and `profile.login`. See [Operators](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/#operators).

            Filters users with a supported expression for a subset of properties.

            > **Note:** Returned users include those with the `DEPROVISIONED` status.

            This requires [URL encoding](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Percent-encoding). For example, `filter=lastUpdated gt "2013-06-01T00:00:00.000Z"` is encoded as `filter=lastUpdated%20gt%20%222013-06-01T00:00:00.000Z%22`. Filtering is case-sensitive for property names and query values, while operators are case-insensitive.

            Filtering supports the following limited number of properties: `status`, `lastUpdated`, `id`, `profile.login`, `profile.email`, `profile.firstName`, and `profile.lastName`.

            Additionally, filtering supports only the equal `eq` operator from the standard Okta API filtering semantics, except in the case of the `lastUpdated` property. This property can also use the inequality operators (`gt`, `ge`, `lt`, and `le`). For logical operators, only the logical operators `and` and `or` are supported. The `not` operator isn't supported. See [Filter](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/#filter) and [Operators](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/#operators).

            Finds users who match the specified query. Use the `q` parameter for simple queries, such as a lookup of users by name when creating a people picker.

            The value of `q` is matched against `firstName`, `lastName`, or `email`. This performs a `startsWith` match, but this is an implementation detail and can change without notice. You don't need to specify `firstName`, `lastName`, or `email`.

            > **Notes:**
            > * Using the `q` parameter in a request omits users that have a status of `DEPROVISIONED`. To return all users, use a `filter` or `search` query instead.

            Requested fields should be comma-separated. Comma-separate the fields and place sub-fields in the profile object inside a `profile:()` directive, for example `profile:(firstName, city)`. The `id` field is always included, regardless of whether it's specified in the `fields` parameter.

        All responses return the created user. Activation of a user is an asynchronous operation. The system performs group reconciliation during activation and assigns the user to all apps via direct or indirect relationships (group memberships).
        * The user's `transitioningToStatus` property is `ACTIVE` during activation to indicate that the user hasn't completed the asynchronous operation.
        * The user's `status` is `ACTIVE` when the activation process is complete.

        The user is emailed a one-time activation token if activated without a password.

        > **Note:** If the user is assigned to an app that is configured for provisioning, the activation process triggers downstream provisioning to the app.  It is possible for a user to sign in before these apps have been successfully provisioned for the user.

        > **Important:** Do not generate or send a one-time activation token when activating users with an assigned password. Users should sign in with their assigned password.

        For more information about the various scenarios of creating a user listed in the examples, see the [User creation scenarios](/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/User/#user-creation-scenarios) section.

        Retrieves a user from your Okta org.

        You can substitute `me` for the `id` to fetch the current user linked to an API token or session cookie.
         * The request returns the user linked to the API token that is specified in the Authorization header, not the user linked to the active session. Details of the admin user who granted the API token is returned.
         * When the end user has an active Okta session, it is typically a CORS request from the browser. Therefore, it's possible to retrieve the current user without the Authorization header.

        When fetching a user by `login` or `login shortname`, [URL encode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Percent-encoding) the request parameter to ensure that special characters are escaped properly. Logins with a `/` character can only be fetched by `id` due to URL issues with escaping the `/` character. If you don't know a user's ID, you can use the [List all users](/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/User/#tag/User/operation/listUsers) endpoint to find it.

        Updates a user's profile or credentials with partial update semantics.

        > **Important:** Use the `POST` method for partial updates. Unspecified properties are set to null with `PUT`.

        `profile` and `credentials` can be updated independently or together with a single request.
        > **Note**: Currently, the user type of a user can only be changed via a full replacement PUT operation. If the request parameters of a partial update include the type element from the user object,
        the value must match the existing type of the user. Only admins are permitted to change the user type of a user; end users are not allowed to change their own user type.

        > **Note**: To update a current user's profile with partial semantics, the `/api/v1/users/me` endpoint can be invoked.
        >
        > A user can only update profile properties for which the user has write access. Within the profile, if the user tries to update the primary or the secondary email IDs, verification emails are sent to those email IDs, and the fields are updated only upon verification.

        If you are using this endpoint to set a password, it sets a password without validating existing user credentials. This is an administrative operation. For operations that validate credentials, refer to the [Reset password](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/UserCred/#tag/UserCred/operation/resetPassword), [Start forgot password flow](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/UserCred/#tag/UserCred/operation/forgotPassword), and [Update password](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/UserCred/#tag/UserCred/operation/changePassword) endpoints.

        Perform this operation only on users that do not have a `DEPROVISIONED` status.
        * The user's `transitioningToStatus` property is `DEPROVISIONED` during deactivation to indicate that the user hasn't completed the asynchronous operation.
        * The user's status is `DEPROVISIONED` when the deactivation process is complete.

        > **Important:** Deactivating a user is a **destructive** operation. The user is deprovisioned from all assigned apps, which might destroy their data such as email or files.
        **This action cannot be recovered!**

        You can also perform user deactivation asynchronously. To invoke asynchronous user deactivation, pass an HTTP header `Prefer: respond-async` with the request.

        Resets a password. Generates a one-time token (OTT) that you can use to reset a user's password. You can automatically email the OTT link to the user or return the OTT to the API caller and distribute using a custom flow.

        This operation transitions the user to the `RECOVERY` status. The user is then not able to sign in or initiate a forgot password flow until they complete the reset flow.

        This operation provides an option to delete all the user's sessions. However, if the request is made in the context of a session owned by the specified user, that session isn't cleared.
        > **Note:** You can also use this API to convert a user with the Okta credential provider to use a federated provider. After this conversion, the user can't directly sign in with a password.
        > To convert a federated user back to an Okta user, use the default API call.

        If an email address is associated with multiple users, keep in mind the following to ensure a successful password recovery lookup:
          * Okta no longer includes deactivated users in the lookup.
          * The lookup searches sign-in IDs first, then primary email addresses, and then secondary email addresses.
          If `sendEmail` is `false`, returns a link for the user to reset their password.

        This operation provides an option to delete all the sessions of the specified user. However, if the request is made in the context of a session owned by the specified user, that session isn't cleared.

        You can only perform this operation on users in `STAGED`, `ACTIVE`, `PASSWORD_EXPIRED`, or `RECOVERY` status that have a valid [password credential](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/User/#tag/User/operation/createUser!path=credentials/password&t=request).

        The user transitions to `ACTIVE` status when successfully invoked in `RECOVERY` status.

        Starts the forgot password flow.

        Generates a one-time token (OTT) that you can use to reset a user's password.

        The user must validate their security question's answer when visiting the reset link. Perform this operation only on users with an `ACTIVE` status and
        a valid [recovery question credential](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/User/#tag/User/operation/createUser!path=credentials/recovery_question&t=request).

        > **Note:** If you have migrated to Identity Engine, you can allow users to recover passwords with any enrolled MFA authenticator. See [Self-service account recovery](https://help.okta.com/oie/en-us/content/topics/identity-engine/authenticators/configure-sspr.htm?cshid=ext-config-sspr).

        If an email address is associated with multiple users, keep in mind the following to ensure a successful password recovery lookup:
          * Okta no longer includes deactivated users in the lookup.
          * The lookup searches sign-in IDs first, then primary email addresses, and then secondary email addresses.

        If `sendEmail` is `false`, returns a link for the user to reset their password. This operation doesn't affect the status of the user.

        #### Additional SMS/Call factor information

        * **Rate limits**: Okta may return a `429 Too Many Requests` status code if you attempt to resend an SMS or a voice call challenge (OTP) within the same time window. The current [rate limit](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/rate-limits/) is one SMS/CALL challenge per phone number every 30 seconds.

        * **Existing phone numbers**: Okta may return a `400 Bad Request` status code if a user attempts to enroll with a different phone number when the user has an existing mobile phone or has an existing phone with voice call capability. A user can enroll only one mobile phone for `sms` and enroll only one voice call capable phone for `call` factor.

        #### Additional WebAuthn factor information

        * For detailed information on the WebAuthn standard, including an up-to-date list of supported browsers, see [webauthn.me](https://a0.to/webauthnme-okta-docs).

        * When you enroll a WebAuthn factor, the `activation` object in `_embedded` contains properties used to help the client to create a new WebAuthn credential for use with Okta. See the [WebAuthn spec for PublicKeyCredentialCreationOptions](https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/#dictionary-makecredentialoptions).

        #### Additional Custom TOTP factor information

        * The enrollment process involves passing both the `factorProfileId` and `sharedSecret` properties for a token.

        * A factor profile represents a particular configuration of the Custom TOTP factor. It includes certain properties that match the hardware token that end users possess, such as the HMAC algorithm, passcode length, and time interval. There can be multiple Custom TOTP factor profiles per org, but users can only enroll in one Custom TOTP factor. Admins can [create Custom TOTP factor profiles](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?id=ext-mfa-totp) in the Admin Console. Then, copy the `factorProfileId` from the Admin Console into the API request.

        * <x-lifecycle class="oie"></x-lifecycle>
        For Custom TOTP enrollment, Okta automaticaly enrolls a user with a `token:software:totp` factor and the `push` factor if the user isn't currently enrolled with these factors.

This can affect which authenticator enrollment policy is evaluated and which factors are returned.

You can configure your `sms` and `call` factors to use a third-party telephony provider. See the [Telephony inline hook reference](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/telephony-hook/). Okta alternates between SMS providers with every resend request to ensure delivery of SMS and Call OTPs across different carriers.

          Verifies an OTP for a factor. Some factors (`call`, `email`, `push`, `sms`, `u2f`, and `webauthn`) must first issue a challenge before you can verify the factor. Do this by making a request without a body. After a challenge is issued, make another request to verify the factor.

          > **Note:**
          > Unlike standard push challenges that don't require a request body, a number matching [`push`](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/UserFactor/#tag/UserFactor/operation/verifyFactor!path=2/useNumberMatchingChallenge&t=request) challenge requires a request body. `useNumberMatchingChallenge` must be set to `true`.
          > When a number matching challenge is issued for an Okta Verify `push` factor enrollment, a `correctAnswer` challenge object is returned in the [`_embedded`](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/UserFactor/#tag/UserFactor/operation/verifyFactor!c=200&path=_embedded&t=response) object.

        Assigns a [standard role](/openapi/okta-management/guides/roles/#standard-roles) to a user.

        You can also assign a custom role to a user, but the preferred method to assign a custom role to a user is to create a binding between the custom role, the resource set, and the user. See [Create a role resource set binding](/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/RoleDResourceSetBinding/#tag/RoleDResourceSetBinding/operation/createResourceSetBinding).

        > **Notes:**
        > * The request payload is different for standard and custom role assignments.
        > * For IAM-based standard role assignments, use the request payload for standard roles. However, the response payload for IAM-based role assignments is similar to the custom role's assignment response.

        Assigns an OIN app target for an `APP_ADMIN` role assignment to an admin user. When you assign the first app target, you reduce the scope of the role assignment.
        The role no longer applies to all app targets, but applies only to the specified target.

        Assigning an OIN app target overrides any existing app instance targets of the OIN app.
        For example, if a user was assigned to administer a specific Facebook instance, a successful request to add an OIN app target with `facebook` for `appName` makes that user the admin for all Facebook instances.

        Replaces a Network Zone by `zoneId`. The replaced Network Zone type must be the same as the existing type.
        You can replace the usage (`POLICY`, `BLOCKLIST`) of a Network Zone by updating the `usage` attribute.

        **IP exempt zone**<br>
        If you have the IP exempt zone feature enabled, you can allow traffic from specific gateway IPs irrespective of Okta ThreatInsight configurations, blocked network zones, or IP change events within Identity Threat Protection with Okta AI.<br>
        <br>
        When you enable this feature, Okta creates a zone called `DefaultExemptIpZone`. Gateway IPs that you add to this zone always have access to Okta resources. See [IP exempt zone](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=oie&id=csh-about-ip-exempt-zone).

        > **Note:** You can't add trusted proxy IPs to this zone, delete the zone, or create additional exempt IP zones.

      summary: Assign a client role
      description: |-
        Assigns a [standard role](/openapi/okta-management/guides/roles/#standard-roles) to a client app.

        You can also assign a custom role to a client app, but the preferred method to assign a custom role to a client is to create a binding between the custom role, the resource set, and the client app. See [Create a role resource set binding](/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/RoleDResourceSetBinding/#tag/RoleDResourceSetBinding/operation/createResourceSetBinding).

        > **Notes:**
        > * The request payload is different for standard and custom role assignments.
        > * For IAM-based standard role assignments, use the request payload for standard roles. However, the response payload for IAM-based role assignments is similar to the custom role's assignment response.

        Assigns an OIN app target for an `APP_ADMIN` role assignment to a client. When you assign an app target from the OIN catalog, you reduce the scope of the role assignment.
        The role assignment applies to only app instances that are included in the specified OIN app target.

        An assigned OIN app target overrides any existing app instance targets.
        For example, if a user is assigned to administer a specific Facebook instance, a successful request to add an OIN app target with `facebook` for `appName` makes that user the administrator for all Facebook instances.

        Creates an Okta telephony inline hook request. This is an automated request from Okta to your third-party service endpoint.

        The objects that you return in the JSON payload of your response to this Okta request are an array of one or more objects,
        which specify the Okta commands to execute.

        >**Note:** The size of your response payload must be less than 256 KB.

        ### About

        The Okta telephony inline hook allows you to integrate your own custom code into Okta flows that send SMS or voice call messages. You can integrate this hook with enrollment, authentication, and recovery flows that involve the phone authenticator. Okta uses your external provider to deliver the one-time passcode (OTP) to the Requester. The provider can respond with commands that indicate if the delivery was successful or not.

        You can have only one active telephony inline hook per org.

        When you create a telephony inline hook, you must include the `authScheme` parameter. See [Create inline hook](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/InlineHook/#tag/InlineHook/operation/createInlineHook) and the [authScheme object](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/InlineHook/#tag/InlineHook/operation/createInlineHook!path=channel/0/config/authScheme&t=request).

        ### Time-out behavior

        If the provider response times out, Okta attempts to send the OTP using the Okta telephony providers. See [Troubleshoot](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/InlineHook/#tag/InlineHook/operation/createTelephonyInlineHook/#troubleshoot).

        >**Note:** The failover mechanism that uses the Okta telephony providers is heavily rate-limited.

        ### Troubleshoot

        This section explains several common causes of failure for telephony inline hooks.

        Note: Administrators can use the [Okta System Log](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/system-log/) to view errors. See the Troubleshooting section in the inline hooks topic for details on events captured by the Okta System Log.

      summary: Create a password import inline hook
      description: |-
        Creates a password import inline hook request, one type of inline hook supported by Okta. This is an automated request from Okta to your third-party service endpoint. This reference provides sample JSON objects that are contained in the outbound request from Okta to your external service,
        and sample JSON objects that you can include in your response. The objects that you return in the JSON payload of your response to this Okta request are an array of one or more objects,
        which specify the Okta commands to execute.

        >**Note:** The size of your response payload must be less than 256 KB.

        The password import inline hook allows you to migrate users from another data store where you want the users to retain their current passwords.
        Use this hook with the [Create user with password import inline hook flow](/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/User/#create-user-with-password-import-inline-hook) that's described in the [Users API](/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/User/).

        The password import inline hook is triggered when the user tries to sign in to Okta for the first time. Okta sends your external service the password that the user supplied. Your external service then needs to send a response to Okta indicating whether the password supplied by the end user is valid.

        If your service returns a response that indicates that the password is valid, Okta sets the password for the user. The password import inline hook won't need to call your service again.
        However, if the Okta service is in read-only mode, it might not be possible to set the password. Okta then needs to call your service again the next time the user attempts to sign in.
        See [Password inline hook and Okta read-only mode](#password-inline-hook-and-okta-read-only-mode) and [Removing password from existing user store](#password-removal-from-an-existing-user-store).

        >**Notes:**
        > * Password policies don't apply to the password import inline hook. That is, if your external service validates the password, the password is imported even if it doesn't meet the Okta password policy requirements.
        > * You can create only one password import inline hook per org.

        ### Enable a password import inline hook

        To enable a password import inline hook, you first need to register your external service endpoint with Okta and configure it as an inline hook of type `com.okta.user.credential.password.import`.
        You can enable the hook using the Admin Console, see [Add an inline hook](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=oie&id=ext-add-inline-hook) or through the [Inline Hooks Management API](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/InlineHook/).
        When creating a user with the Users API, you need to use the [Create User with password import inline hook](/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/User/#create-user-with-password-import-inline-hook) use case.
        This involves specifying a `credentials.password.hook` property in the request body.

        When the user that you have added attempts to sign in to Okta for the first time, the hook is triggered and Okta calls your external service. The call sends the credentials that the end user provided. Your service can check
        the credentials and respond with a command to indicate whether the credentials are valid or not.

        ### Password inline hook and Okta read-only mode

        If your external service responds to Okta indicating that the credentials are valid, Okta saves the password and can authenticate the user independently from then on. However, if your Okta org is in a special [read-only mode](https://support.okta.com/help/s/article/What-is-Oktas-Readonly-Mode)
        at the time the user signs in, then saving the password might not be possible. The next time the end user attempts to sign in, the password import inline hook needs to be called again.

        ### Password removal from an existing user store

        Because of the possibility of your org being in a special service mode, you shouldn't attempt to permanently delete user passwords from your existing user store until you can verify the success of the password import . An Okta System Log Event, `user.import.password`, is available for this purpose. An event of this type is created every time a password import inline hook is fired, with its `Event.Outcome` property providing a status of `FAILURE` or `SUCCESS` for the password import operation.
        If the status is `SUCCESS`, Okta has successfully saved the end user's password, and it's safe to delete it from your previous user store.

        You can configure an [Event hook](https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/event-hooks/) to send this event type to you for use when triggering automated cleanup of end-user
        passwords after successful migration.

        The Okta registration inline hook allows you to integrate your own custom code into Okta's [Profile Enrollment](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=oie&id=ext-create-profile-enrollment) flow. The hook is triggered after Okta receives the registration or profile update request. Your custom code can:
        - Allow or deny the registration attempt, based on your own validation of the information the user has submitted
        - Set or override the values that are populated in attributes of the user's Okta profile
        > **Note:** Profile Enrollment and self-service registration (SSR) inline hooks only work with the [Okta Sign-In Widget](https://developer.okta.com/code/javascript/okta_sign-in_widget/) version 4.5 or later.

      summary: Create a SAML assertion inline hook
      description: |-
        Creates a SAML assertion inline hook request, one type of inline hook supported by Okta. This is an automated request from Okta to your third-party service endpoint. This reference provides sample JSON objects that are contained in the outbound request from Okta to your external service, and sample JSON objects that you can include in your response. The objects that you return in the JSON payload of your response to this Okta request are an array of one or more objects, which specify the Okta commands to execute.

        This type of inline hook is triggered when Okta generates a SAML assertion in response to an authentication request. Before sending the SAML assertion to the app that will consume it, Okta calls out to your external service. Your external service can respond with commands to add attributes to the assertion or to modify its existing attributes.

        You can use this functionality to add data to assertions, which might be data that is sensitive, calculated at runtime, or complexly-structured and not appropriate for storing in Okta user profiles. Data added this way is never logged or stored by Okta. As an example, SAML assertions generated for a medical app could be augmented with confidential patient data provided by your external service and not stored in Okta.

        This inline hook works only when using custom SAML apps, not apps from the OIN.

        See also:
          * [Inline hooks](https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/inline-hooks/) for a general introduction to Okta inline hooks

          * For steps to enable this inline hook, see [Add an inline hook](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=oie&id=ext-add-inline-hook).

        ### Specify location within the assertion

        Specify the location within the assertion where you want to apply your operation using a slash-delimited path, which follows JSON Patch conventions.

        When you perform an `add` op to add a new attribute statement, begin with `/claims/` and follow that with the name of the new attribute that you're adding.

        When you modify an existing assertions statement, begin the path with `/subject/`, `/authentication/`, `/conditions/`, or `/claims/`, depending on which part of the assertion you want to modify. You then look deeper within the child elements using slash-delimited element names, for example, `/claims/array/attributeValues/1/value`. (The `/1/` in the path indicates the index of the array, using zero-based indexing.)

        ### URI claims

        Okta supports URI claims with SAML assertion hooks. When you need to replace or add a URI claim, encode the claim name within the command per the [JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Pointer](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901) specification. Specifically, this replaces `~` with `~0` and `/` with `~1`.

        ### SessionNotOnOrAfter support

        In some scenarios, your service provider may require the `SessionNotOnOrAfter` attribute for the `<saml:AuthnStatement>` in the SAML assertion, which sets the provider session time correctly. Use `add` op with the path `/authentication/sessionLifetime` and a value for session lifetime in seconds to add this attribute. Okta calculates `SessionNotOnOrAfter` by adding the `/authentication/sessionLifetime` value to the `issueInstant` attribute and returns it in the SAML `data.assertion.

      summary: Create a token inline hook
      description: |-
        Creates a token inline hook request, one type of inline hook supported by Okta. This is an automated request from Okta to your third-party service endpoint. This reference provides sample JSON objects that are contained in the outbound request from Okta to your external service, and sample JSON objects that you can include in your response.

        This type of inline hook is triggered when OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC) tokens are minted by your Okta custom authorization server. Before sending the token to the requester, Okta calls out to your external service. Your service can then respond with commands to add custom claims to the token or to modify existing claims.

        Use this functionality to add data that is sensitive, calculated at runtime, or complexly structured and not appropriate for storing in Okta user profiles. Okta never logs nor stores data that is added this way. As an example, tokens minted for a medical app could be augmented with confidential patient data provided by your external service and not stored in Okta.

        In addition to adding custom claims, you can modify or remove an existing custom claim or an OIDC standard profile claim. You can also update how long an access token or an ID token is valid.

        This inline hook works only when using an [Okta custom authorization server](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/customize-authz-server/main/#create-an-authorization-server), not the built-in Okta org authorization server.

        See also:
          * [Inline hooks](https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/inline-hooks/) for a general introduction to Okta inline hooks
          * [Inline Hooks Management API](/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/InlineHook/) for information on the API for registering external service endpoints with Okta
          * For an example implementation of this inline hook, see [Token inline hook](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/token-inline-hook)

        ### Timeout behavior
        After receiving the Okta request, if there's a response timeout, the Okta process flow proceeds with the original token returned.

        ### Enabling a token inline hook
        To activate the inline hook, you first need to register your external service endpoint with Okta using the [Inline Hooks Management API](/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/InlineHook).
        You then need to associate the registered inline hook with a custom authorization server policy rule by completing the following steps:
        1. Go to **Security** > **API** > **Authorization Servers.**
        2. Select a custom authorization server from the list.
        3. Select **Access Policies** and select a policy to use with the hook. In most cases, pick the Default Policy.
        4. One of the policy's rules needs to trigger the inline hook. Click the pencil icon for a rule to edit it. If you only have one rule, edit the Default Policy Rule.
        5. Click the **Use this Inline Hook** dropdown menu. Any inline hooks that you have registered are listed. Select the hook that you would like to use.
        6. Click **Update Rule**.

        > **Note:** You can associate only one inline hook with each rule.

        ### Troubleshoot
        This section covers what happens when a token inline hook flow fails either due to the external inline hook service returning an error object or not returning a successful response, or the inline hook patch fails.
        > **Note:** Administrators can use the [Okta System Log](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/system-log/) to view errors. See the [Troubleshooting](https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/inline-hooks/#troubleshooting) section in the inline hooks concept piece for more information on the events related to inline hooks that the Okta System Log captures.
        - When there's a communication failure with the external service, a timeout for example, the inline hook operation is skipped. The token is generated without any modification from the inline hook.

          **Who can see this error?** Administrators

        - When the external service returns a response with any other HTTP status code besides `200`, the inline hook operation is skipped. The token is generated without any modification from the inline hook.

          **Who can see this error?** Administrators

        - When the external service returns an error object in the response, the entire token inline hook flow fails with no token generated.

          **Who can see this error?** Administrators, developers, and end users. When the OAuth 2.0 client receives the error, the client developer can see that error if the client has the debug information. What the end user sees depends on how errors are handled within the client.
          > **Note:** See the [error](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/token-hook/#error) section on this page for more information on what to include in the error object of your response and what the OAuth 2.0 error includes that Okta returns to the requestor of the token.

        - When a hook command (for example, updating, adding, and deleting claims) can't be performed, the inline hook operation is skipped. The token is generated without any modification from the inline hook.

          **Who can see this error?** Administrators

          The following actions result in an error:
            - Using an invalid command. For example, if only an ID token is requested, the `commands` array shouldn't contain commands of the type `com.okta.access.patch`.
            - Using an invalid operation
            - Attempting to remove a system-specific claim
            - Attempting to update a claim that doesn't exist
            - Attempting to update an element within an array that doesn't exist or specifying an invalid index
            - Attempting to remove a claim that doesn't exist

        Specifies the media type of the resource. Optional `okta-response` value can be included for performance optimization.

        Complex DelAuth configurations may degrade performance when fetching specific parts of the response, and passing this parameter can omit these parts, bypassing the bottleneck.

        Enum values for `okta-response`:
          * `omitCredentials`: Omits the credentials subobject from the response.
          * `omitCredentialsLinks`: Omits the following HAL links from the response: Update password, Change recovery question, Start forgot password flow, Reset password, Reset factors, Unlock.
          * `omitTransitioningToStatus`: Omits the `transitioningToStatus` field from the response.

            `issuerMode` is visible if you have a custom URL domain configured or the Dynamic Issuer Mode feature enabled. If you have a custom URL domain configured, you can set a custom domain URL in a custom authorization server, and this property is returned in the appropriate responses.

            When set to `ORG_URL`, then in responses, `issuer` is the Okta org domain URL: `https://${yourOktaDomain}`.

            When set to `CUSTOM_URL`, then in responses, `issuer` is the custom domain URL configured in the administration user interface.

            When set to `DYNAMIC`, then in responses, `issuer` is the custom domain URL if the OAuth 2.0 request was sent to the custom domain, or is the Okta org's domain URL if the OAuth 2.0 request was sent to the original Okta org domain.

            After you configure a custom URL domain, all new custom authorization servers use `CUSTOM_URL` by default. If the Dynamic Issuer Mode feature is enabled, then all new custom authorization servers use `DYNAMIC` by default. All existing custom authorization servers continue to use the original value until they're changed using the Admin Console or the API. This way, existing integrations with the client and resource server continue to work after the feature is enabled.

Each requirement must correspond to a different major version (Windows 11 or Windows 10). If a requirement isn't specified for a major version, then devices on that major version satisfy the condition.

                There are two types of OS requirements:
                * **Static**: A specific Windows version requirement that doesn't change until you update the policy. A static OS Windows requirement is specified with `majorVersionConstraint` and `minimum`.
                * **Dynamic**: A Windows version requirement that is relative to the latest major release and security patch. A dynamic OS Windows requirement is specified with `majorVersionConstraint` and `dynamicVersionRequirement`.

                > **Note:** Dynamic OS requirements are available only if the **Dynamic OS version compliance** [self-service EA](/openapi/okta-management/guides/release-lifecycle/#early-access-ea) feature is enabled. The `osVersionConstraints` property is only supported for the Windows platform. You can't specify both `osVersion.minimum` and `osVersionConstraints` properties at the same time.

        Specifies required and optional properties for a group. The `objectClass` of a group determines which additional properties are available.

        You can extend group profiles with custom properties, but you must first add the properties to the group profile schema before you can reference them. Use the Profile Editor in the Admin Console or the [Schemas API](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/Schema/) to manage schema extensions.

        Custom properties can contain HTML tags. It is the client's responsibility to escape or encode this data before displaying it. Use [best-practices](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross_Site_Scripting_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html) to prevent cross-site scripting.

            Non-empty array of valid JSON schemas.

            The `oneOf` key is only supported in conjunction with `enum` and provides a mechanism to return a display name for the `enum` value.<br>
            Each schema has the following format:

            ```
            {
              "const": "enumValue",
              "title": "display name"
            }
            ```

            When `enum` is used in conjunction with `oneOf`, you must keep the set of enumerated values and their order.<br>
            For example:

            ```
            "enum": ["S","M","L","XL"],
            "oneOf": [
                {"const": "S", "title": "Small"},
                {"const": "M", "title": "Medium"},
                {"const": "L", "title": "Large"},

        The IdP object's `type` property identifies the social or enterprise IdP used for authentication.
        Each IdP uses a specific protocol, therefore the `protocol` object must correspond with the IdP `type`.
        If the protocol is OAuth 2.0-based, the `protocol` object's `scopes` property must also correspond with the scopes supported by the IdP `type`.
        For policy actions supported by each IdP type, see [IdP type policy actions](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/IdentityProvider/#tag/IdentityProvider/operation/createIdentityProvider!path=policy&t=request).

    LogAuthenticationContext:
      description: |-
        All authentication relies on validating one or more credentials that prove the authenticity of the actor's identity. Credentials are sometimes provided by the actor, as is the case with passwords, and at other times provided by a third party, and validated by the authentication provider.

        The authenticationContext contains metadata about how the actor is authenticated. For example, an authenticationContext for an event, where a user authenticates with Integrated Windows Authentication (IWA), looks like the following:
        ```
        {
            "authenticationProvider": "ACTIVE_DIRECTORY",
            "authenticationStep": 0,
            "credentialProvider": null,
            "credentialType": "IWA",
            "externalSessionId": "102N1EKyPFERROGvK9wizMAPQ",
            "interface": null,
            "issuer": null
        }
        ```
        In this case, the user enters an IWA credential to authenticate against an Active Directory instance. All of the user's future-generated events in this sign-in session are going to share the same `externalSessionId`.

        Among other operations, this response object can be used to scan for suspicious sign-in activity or perform analytics on user authentication habits (for example, how often authentication scheme X is used versus authentication scheme Y).

    LogDebugContext:
      description: |-
        For some kinds of events (for example, OLM provisioning, sign-in request, second factor SMS, and so on), the fields that are provided in other response objects aren't sufficient to adequately describe the operations that the event has performed. In such cases, the `debugContext` object provides a way to store additional information.

        For example, an event where a second factor SMS token is sent to a user may have a `debugContext` that looks like the following:
        ```
        {
            "debugData": {
                "requestUri": "/api/v1/users/00u3gjksoiRGRAZHLSYV/factors/smsf8luacpZJAva10x45/verify",
                "smsProvider": "TELESIGN",
                "transactionId": "268632458E3C100F5F5F594C6DC689D4"
            }
        }
        ```
        By inspecting the debugData field, you can find the URI that is used to trigger the second factor SMS (`/api/v1/users/00u3gjksoiRGRAZHLSYV/factors/smsf8luacpZJAva10x45/verify`), the SMS provider (`TELESIGN`), and the ID used by Telesign to identify this transaction (`268632458E3C100F5F5F594C6DC689D4`).

        If for some reason the information that is needed to implement a feature isn't provided in other response objects, you should scan the `debugContext.debugData` field for potentially useful fields.
        > **Important:** The information contained in `debugContext.debugData` is intended to add context when troubleshooting customer platform issues. Both key names and values may change from release to release and aren't guaranteed to be stable. Therefore, they shouldn't be viewed as a data contract but as a debugging aid instead.

    LogTransaction:

        A `transaction` object comprises contextual information associated with its respective event.
        This information is useful for understanding sequences of correlated events.
        For example, a `transaction` object such as the following:
        ```
        {
          "id": "Wn4f-0RQ8D8lTSLkAmkKdQAADqo",
          "type": "WEB",
          "detail": null
        }
        ```
        indicates that a `WEB` request with `id` `Wn4f-0RQ8D8lTSLkAmkKdQAADqo` has created this event.

        A `transaction` object with a `requestApiTokenId` in the `detail` object, for example :
        ```
        {
          "id": "YjSlblAAqnKY7CdyCkXNBgAAAIU",
          "type": "WEB",
          "detail": {
            "requestApiTokenId": "00T94e3cn9kSEO3c51s5"
          }
        }
        ```
        indicates that this event was the result of an action performed through an API using the token identified by 00T94e3cn9kSEO3c51s5. The token ID is visible in the Admin Console, **Security** > **API**. See [API token management](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?id=Security_API). For more information on API tokens, see [Create an API token](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/create-an-api-token/).

        > **Notes:**

        > * When a scope is requested during a Client Credentials grant flow and `consent` is set to `FLEXIBLE`, the scope is granted in the access token with no consent prompt. This occurs because there is no user involved in a two-legged OAuth 2.0 [Client Credentials](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/implement-grant-type/clientcreds/main/) grant flow.

              Any configured redirect URIs may contain a single `*` character in the lowest-level domain (for example, `https://redirect-*-domain.example.com/oidc/redirect`) to act as a wildcard.
              The wildcard subdomain must have at least one subdomain between it and the top level domain.
              The wildcard can match any valid hostname characters, but can't span more than one domain.
              For example, if `https://redirect-*-domain.example.com/oidc/redirect` is configured as a redirect URI, then `https://redirect-1-domain.example.com/oidc/redirect` and `https://redirect-sub-domain.example.com/oidc/redirect` match, but `https://redirect-1.sub-domain.example.com/oidc/redirect` doesn't match.
              Only the `https` URI scheme can use wildcard redirect URIs.
              > **Note:** The use of wildcard subdomains is discouraged as an insecure practice, since it may allow malicious actors to have tokens or authorization codes sent to unexpected or attacker-controlled pages. Exercise caution if you decide to include a wildcard redirect URI in your configuration.

        When you create or update an OAuth 2.0 client, you can configure refresh token rotation by setting the `rotation_type` and `leeway` properties. If you don't set these properties when you create an app integration, the default values are used.
        When you update an app integration, your previously configured values are used.

            > **Note:** A leeway of 0 doesn't necessarily mean that the previous token is immediately invalidated. The previous token is invalidated after the new token is generated and returned in the response.

        When a user has a valid password, imported hashed password, or password hook, and a response object contains
        a password credential, then the password object is a bare object without the value property defined (for example, `password: {}`). This indicates that a password value exists. You can modify password policy requirements in the Admin Console by editing the Password authenticator:  **Security** > **Authenticators** > **Password** (or for Okta Classic orgs, use **Security** > **Authentication** > **Password**).

        For information on defaults and configuring your password policies, see [Configure the password authenticator](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=oie&id=ext-configure-password) in the help documentation.

        Specifies a hashed password to import into Okta. This allows an existing password to be imported into Okta directly

         A hashed password may be specified in a password object when creating or updating a user, but not for other operations.
         See the [Create user with imported hashed password](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/User/#create-user-with-imported-hashed-password) description. When you update a user with a hashed password, the user must be in the `STAGED` status.

            * As a best security practice, you should define a regular expression pattern to filter untrusted IdP usernames. This is especially important if multiple IdPs are connected to your org. The filter prevents an IdP from issuing an assertion for any user, including partners or directory users in your Okta org.
            * For example, the filter pattern `(\S+@example\.com)` allows only Users that have an `@example.com` username suffix. It rejects assertions that have any other suffix such as `@corp.example.com` or `@partner.com`.
            * Only `SAML2` and `OIDC` IdP providers support the `filter` property.

        * To successfully provision a new Okta user, you must enable just-in-time (JIT) provisioning in your org security settings.
        * If the target username isn't unique or the resulting Okta user profile is missing a required profile attribute, JIT provisioning may fail.
        * New Okta users are provisioned with either a `FEDERATION` or `SOCIAL` authentication provider depending on the IdP type.

      properties:
        commands:
          description: |-
            The `commands` object lets you invoke commands to modify or add values to the attributes in the Okta user profile that are created for this user. The object also lets you control whether or not the registration attempt is allowed to proceed.

            This object is an array, allowing you to send multiple commands in your response. Each array element requires a `type` property and a `value` property. The `type` property is where you specify which of the supported commands you wish to execute, and `value` is where you supply parameters for that command.

            The registration inline hook supports these three commands:
            * `com.okta.user.profile.update`: Change attribute values in the user's Okta user profile. For SSR only. Invalid if used with a Progressive Profile response.
            * `com.okta.action.update`: Allow or deny the user's registration.
            * `com.okta.user.progressive.profile.update`: Change attribute values in the user's Okta Progressive Profile.
          type: array
          items:
            type: object
            properties:
              type:
                description: |-
                  The location where you specify the command. To set attributes in the user's Okta profile, supply a `type` property set to `com.okta.user.profile.update`, together with a `value` property set to a list of key-value pairs corresponding to the Okta user profile attributes you want to set. The attributes must already exist in your user profile schema.

                  To explicitly allow or deny registration to the user, supply a type property set to `com.okta.action.update`, together with a value property set to `{"registration": "ALLOW"}` or `{"registration": "DENY"}`. The default is to allow registration.

                  In Okta Identity Engine, to set attributes in the user's profile, supply a `type` property set to `com.okta.user.progressive.profile.update`, together with a `value` property set to a list of key-value pairs corresponding to the Progressive Enrollment attributes that you want to set. See [Registration inline hook - Send response](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/registration-inline-hook/nodejs/main/#send-response).

                  Commands are applied in the order that they appear in the array. Within a single `com.okta.user.profile.update` or `com.okta.user.progressive.profile.update command`, attributes are updated in the order that they appear in the `value` object.

                  You can never use a command to update the user's password, but you are allowed to set the values of attributes other than password that are designated sensitive in your Okta user schema. However, the values of those sensitive attributes, if included as fields in the Profile Enrollment form, aren't included in the `data.userProfile` object sent to your external service by Okta. See [data.userProfile](/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/InlineHook/#tag/InlineHook/operation/create-registration-hook!path=0/data/userProfile&t=request).
                type: string
              value:
                additionalProperties: true
                description: |-
                  The `value` object is the parameter to pass to the command.

                  For `com.okta.user.profile.update` commands, `value` should be an object containing one or more name-value pairs for the attributes you wish to update.

                  For `com.okta.action.update` commands, the value should be an object containing the attribute `action` set to a value of either `ALLOW` or `DENY`, indicating whether the registration should be permitted or not.

                  Registrations are allowed by default, so setting a value of `ALLOW` for the action field is valid but superfluous.

        Error:
          description: |-
            For the registration inline hook, the `error` object provides a way of displaying an error message to the end user who is trying to register or update their profile.

            * If you're using the Okta Sign-In Widget for Profile Enrollment, only the `errorSummary` messages of the `errorCauses` objects that your external service returns appear as inline errors, given the following:
              * You don't customize the error handling behavior of the widget.
              * The `location` of `errorSummary` in the `errorCauses` object specifies the request object's user profile attribute.
            * If you don't return a value for the `errorCauses` object, and deny the user's registration attempt through the `commands` object in your response to Okta, one of the following generic messages appears to the end user:
              * "Registration cannot be completed at this time." (SSR)
              * "We found some errors. Please review the form and make corrections." (Progressive Enrollment)
            * If you don't return an `error` object at all and the registration is denied, the following generic message appears to the end user:
              * "Registration denied." (SSR)
              * "Profile update denied." (Progressive Enrollment)

            >**Note:** If you include an error object in your response, no commands are executed and the registration fails. This holds true even if the top-level `errorSummary` and the `errorCauses` objects are omitted.

        okta_post_message: |-
          Uses [HTML5 Web Messaging](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage) (for example, `window.postMessage()`) instead of the redirect for the authorization response from the `/authorize` endpoint.

          `okta_post_message` is an adaptation of the [Web Message Response Mode](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-sakimura-oauth-wmrm-00#section-4.1).
          This value provides a secure way for a single-page application to perform a sign-in flow in a pop-up window or an iFrame and receive the ID token, access token, and/or authorization code back in the parent page without leaving the context of that page. The data object for the `postMessage` call is in the next section.

            The `commands` object is where you tell Okta to add additional claims to the assertion or to modify the existing assertion statements.

            `commands` is an array, allowing you to send multiple commands. In each array element, include a `type` property and a `value` property. The `type` property is where you specify which of the supported commands you want to execute, and `value` is where you supply an operand for that command.
            In the case of the SAML assertion inline hook, the `value` property is itself a nested object, in which you specify a particular operation, a path to act on, and a value.

            The `commands` object is an array, allowing you to send multiple commands. In each array element, there needs to be a `type` property and `value` property. The `type` property is where you specify which of the supported commands you want to execute, and `value` is where you supply an operand for that command.
            In the case of the token hook type, the `value` property is itself a nested object in which you specify a particular operation, a path to act on, and a value.

                          Append an element to an array by specifying the name of the array, followed by the index where you want to insert the element in the path. Alternatively, you can specify the array name followed by a hyphen (-) in the path to append an element at the end of the array. For example, you have an array that contains the user's preferred airports, and you want to add a new airport to the array. The existing target JSON object is updated by specifying the claim in the path, followed by the index of where to insert the claim.

                          You can modify (`replace`) existing custom claims or OIDC standard profile claims, such as `birthdate` and `locale`. You can't, however, modify any system-specific claims, such as `iss` or `ver`. Also, you can't modify a claim that isn't currently part of the token in the request payload. Attempting to modify a system-specific claim or using an invalid operation results in the entire PATCH failing and errors logged in the token hooks events.

                          See [ID Token Claims](/openapi/okta-oauth/guides/overview/#id-token-claims) for a list of ID token-reserved claims that you can't modify.

                        <summary>Remove members from existing arrays</summary>

                          Use the `remove` operation to remove members from existing arrays. For example, you have an array that contains the user's preferred airports, and you want to remove an airport from the array. The existing target JSON object is updated by specifying the array name followed by the index of the element that you want to remove. You don't need to specify a value for the remove operation, but you can specify `null` as the value if you want.

                          **Existing target JSON object**

                          ```

                         Use the `remove` operation to remove members from existing JSON objects. Do this by specifying the JSON object in the path, followed by the claim member that you would like to remove. For example, you have an `employee_profile` claim, and you want to remove `email` from it.

You can use the Profile Editor in the Admin Console or the [Schemas API](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/UISchema/#tag/UISchema) to make schema modifications.

        You can extend user profiles with custom properties. You must first add the custom property to the user profile schema before you reference it.

            The unique identifier for the user (`username`). For validation, see [Login pattern validation](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/schemas/#login-pattern-validation).

            Every user within your Okta org must have a unique identifier for a login. This constraint applies to all users you import from other systems or applications such as Active Directory. Your organization is the top-level namespace to mix and match logins from all your connected applications or directories. Careful consideration of naming conventions for your login identifier will make it easier to onboard new applications in the future.

            Logins are not considered unique if they differ only in case and/or diacritical marks. If one of your users has a login of Isaac.Brock@example.com, there cannot be another user whose login is isaac.brock@example.com, nor isáàc.bröck@example.com.

            Okta has a default ambiguous name resolution policy for usernames that include @-signs. (By default, usernames must be formatted as email addresses and thus always include @-signs. You can remove that restriction using either the Admin Console or the [Schemas API](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/Schema/). Users can sign in with their non-qualified short name (for example: isaac.brock with username isaac.brock@example.com) as long as the short name is still unique within the organization.

        All Okta-defined profile properties are defined in a profile subschema with the resolution scope `#base`. You can't modify these properties, except to update permissions, to change the nullability of `firstName` and `lastName`, or to specify a pattern for `login`. They can't be removed.

        The base user profile is based on the [System for Cross-domain Identity Management: Core Schema](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-scim-core-schema-22#section-4.1.1) and has the standard properties detailed below.

            Unique identifier for the user (`userName`)

            The login property is validated according to its pattern attribute, which is a string. By default, the attribute is null. When the attribute is null, the username is required to be formatted as an email address as defined by [RFC 6531 Section 3.3](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6531#section-3.3). The pattern can be set through the API to one of the following forms. (The Admin Console provides access to the same forms.)
              * A login pattern of `".+"` indicates that there is no restriction on usernames. Any non-empty, unique value is permitted, and the minimum length of five isn't enforced. In this case, usernames don't need to include the `@` character. If a name does include `@`, the portion ahead of the `@` can be used for logging in, provided it identifies a unique user within the org.
              * A login pattern of the form `"[...]+"` indicates that usernames must only contain characters from the set given between the brackets. The enclosing brackets and final `+` are required for this form. Character ranges can be indicated using hyphens. To include the hyphen itself in the allowed set, the hyphen must appear first. Any characters in the set except the hyphen, a-z, A-Z, and 0-9 must be preceded by a backslash (`\`). For example, `"[a-z13579\.]+"` would restrict usernames to lowercase letters, odd digits, and periods, while `"[-a-zA-Z0-9]+"` would allow basic alphanumeric characters and hyphens.

Okta doesn't asynchronously sweep through users and update their password expiry state, for example. Instead, Okta evaluates password policy at login time, notices the password has expired, and moves the user to the expired state. When running reports, remember that the data is valid as of the last login or lifecycle event for that user.

            IN_PROGRESS: The verification process is ongoing. This is a transient state that occurs only when the domain name is actively being checked by the server.
            VERIFIED: The domain has been successfully verified. When configuring the domain name to the default Okta org domain or the fully qualified domain name of an existing custom brand domain, the `validationStatus` is immediately returned as `VERIFIED`. No additional verification is required.
            ERROR: There was an error during the verification process. This isn't a terminal state and can be resolved by correcting the DNS record and retrying the verification.
