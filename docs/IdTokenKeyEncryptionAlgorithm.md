# IdTokenKeyEncryptionAlgorithm

<x-lifecycle-container><x-lifecycle class=\"ea\"></x-lifecycle></x-lifecycle-container>JWE alg algorithm for encrypting the ID token issued to this client. If this is requested, the response is signed, and then encrypted with the result being a nested JWT. The default, if omitted, is that no encryption is performed. See the [Application Public Keys API](/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/ApplicationSSOPublicKeys/) for more information on encryption keys. See [Key management](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/key-management/main/) for more information on how encryption keys are used.
